# Touchdesigner 101

Touchdesigner is an incredibly powerful software that offers an endless array of creative potential in every area of digital art.

Unfortunately, the very rapid evolution of the software and the vastness of its application territories have made it difficult to write an organic and structured documentation.

However, although there are no real guides yet, the developer community has generously produced excellent application tutorials in every field.

This folder contains the best introductury courses of the moment (content is adjusted from year to year) with videos and example files already coded.

Credits due to the authors are always given.
