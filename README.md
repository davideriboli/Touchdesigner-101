# Touchdesigner 101

This repository contains all the materials from my courses on Generative Art with [Touchdesigner](https://derivative.ca/). The repository is organized in the form of an Obsidian Vault, so you should get [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) first and then open the main directory as a *vault*.

The repository contains files coded by me, other authors and my students. Credits are always given in the accompanying notes.
